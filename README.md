Description
This is a Social Network API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose. The API allows users to share thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and manage a list of friends. It provides full CRUD functionality for users and thoughts, as well as the ability to add and remove friends and reactions.
